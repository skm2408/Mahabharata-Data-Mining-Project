### Environment setup

Create a new virtual environment and install all the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt.

### Data Source and Extraction

- Downloaded raw data from the [Internet Sacred Text Archive](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/maha/) and stored them in the mahabharata-english folder. Processed this raw data to create the datasets used in insights and our model.
- The processed datasets are stored in the data/ folder and the script used to process the raw data is Data Collection/read_mahabharata.ipynb.

### Execution

- Simply unzip the zip file and run each of the notebooks present in the Auto-Complete folder and Auto-Suggestion folder respectively
- The following are the scripts for each of the tasks:

    - Insights:
        - Data Analysis and Auto-Completion words Dumping -> Auto-Complete.ipynb
        - Neural-Network Model Auto-Suggestion -> lstm.ipynb(Already trained model is present with name as mymodel.h5.Load it directly in the ipynb file)
        - Probabilistic Model Auto-Suggestion -> Auto_Suggest.ipynb
